Thank you for your helping hand! Here are some guidelines I would like you to follow:

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue.

Try and follow pep8 when you can.

Make sure you test your changes.

Don't break existing functionality I try to maintain the Master Branch in a working order.

Ensure you create separate merge request on a diferent branch for each issue or feature, that will accelerate the merging process without interfering with other issues, once I have tested the code I will merge back.
